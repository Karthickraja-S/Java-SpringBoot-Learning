Eclipse : 

Help -> MarketPlace -> Download Spring Starter Tools 4 -> Restart IDE

After restart , File -> New -> Project -> Search For Spring Boot -> Click Spring starter Project -> Give project name and details -> add dependency -> 
click finish and u will get the spring boot application.



Intellij : 

U cant direclty create project as u created in eclipse in community version. It will be available in enterprise only.

However to use in community version , go to start.spring.io, give all the details , download zip file and open in IntelliJ , now u can run Spring Boot project
in community version.


Why spring : 
1. When we use tomcat and JSP , Servlets to deploy and start a web app, we face many dependency issues taking all jar files including in web.xml
and more code for JDBC connection and etc.,
2. To minimise all those stuff , spring fw arrives. ( To resolve dependency issues , maven is there && to reduce boiler plate code spring FW is there )
